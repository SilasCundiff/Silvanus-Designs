# Silvanus Designs Portfolio - Silas Cundiff

This is a re-write of my portfolio in react. I originally wrote it with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I have since learned a lot about React and a lot of the hack-y type things I had to do to make my original portfolio function were not clean and efficient.

TODO:

- make mobile nav close when link is clicked
- add resume link
- make all buttons function
- add contact form functionality
- update footer video credits
- custom nav toggle icon
- ~~bugfix projects page layout moving on card collapse~~
- make projects page responsive
- make cards collapse on projects page on tablet and smaller
