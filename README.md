# Silvanus Designs Portfolio - Silas Cundiff

This is a re-write of my portfolio in react. I originally wrote it with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I have since learned a lot about React and a lot of the hack-y type things I had to do to make my original portfolio function were not clean and efficient.

TODO:

- make mobile nav close when link is clicked
- add resume link to home content
- make all buttons function
- add contact form functionality
- update footer video credits
